# C++ Logic & Problem-Solving Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects focused on developing programming logic and problem-solving skills.

The projects cover:
- Algorithms and problem-solving exercises
- Matrix and array operations
- File handling systems
- Console-based management systems
- Object-Oriented Programming practice
- Data structure fundamentals

These projects were built as part of my programming training journey before focusing fully on engineering and simulation.

The goal of this repository is not to showcase production software, but to demonstrate logical thinking and structured problem-solving skills.

Future repositories will focus on:
- MATLAB engineering projects
- SolidWorks and simulation projects
- Engineering analysis and virtual testing
